<p>
 ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Breno, also known as ChN44. I am a developer in pursuit of ascension through relentless study and unwavering dedication.

  - ðŸŒ± I am currently immersed in Systems Analysis and Development at SENAI Brazil â€” forging my foundation where others merely attend.

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m seeking my first professional opportunity. My ultimate vision? To rise as a Data Scientist â€” not by chance, but by sheer will.
</p>
